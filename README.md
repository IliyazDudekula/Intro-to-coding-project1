# Connect Four Game with AI

This repository contains the implementation of the classic Connect Four game, where you can play against an AI using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game is developed in Python and uses the Pygame library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Game Overview

Connect Four is a two-player game where the objective is to be the first to get four of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on a 7x6 grid. In this implementation:

- **Player 1 (Red): The human player
- **Player 2 (Yellow): The AI, which plays against the human player

The game board has 6 rows and 7 columns. Players take turns dropping pieces into the columns. The piece falls to the lowest available space in the chosen column. The game ends when one player connects four pieces in a row, or the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## Features

- Human vs. AI: You can play as the first player (Red) against an AI opponent (Yellow).
- AI using Minimax Algorithm: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to decide on the best move to make.
- Graphical Interface: A GUI is built with Pygame to visually display the game board and pieces.
- Responsive Gameplay: Players can interact with the game by clicking on the columns to drop their pieces.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

You can install Pygame by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

1. Start the Game: Run the script to start the game.
2. Player's Move: As the first player (Red), move the mouse to the desired column and click to drop your piece.
3. AI's Move: After the player's move, the AI will automatically make its move.
4. Winning the Game: The game ends when either the player or the AI connects four pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
5. Game Over: If either player wins, the result is displayed on the screen, and the game will end after a few seconds.

## Game Logic

### Board Representation

The board is represented as a 2D NumPy array of size 6x7, where:
- `0` represents an empty spot,
- `1` represents the player's piece (Red),
- `2` represents the AI's piece (Yellow).

### Functions

- create_board(): Initializes an empty game board.
- drop_piece(board, row, col, piece): Drops a piece into the board at the specified row and column.
- is_valid_location(board, col): Checks if a column is a valid location for dropping a piece (i.e., not full).
- get_next_open_row(board, col): Returns the row number of the next available spot in the specified column.
- winning_move(board, piece): Checks if a given piece (Red or Yellow) has won the game by connecting four pieces in a row.
- evaluate_window(window, piece): Evaluates a window (a sequence of 4 adjacent spaces) and assigns a score based on its content (favoring the player's pieces).
- score_position(board, piece): Calculates the score for a given board configuration, considering horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.
- minimax(board, depth, alpha, beta, maximizingPlayer): The core AI function that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to find the optimal move.
- get_valid_locations(board): Returns a list of columns where a piece can be dropped.
- draw_board(board): Draws the current state of the game board on the Pygame window.

### AI Logic

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to evaluate and decide on the best possible move. The algorithm:
- Maximizes the AI's score and minimize the player's score.
- Recursively evaluates all possible moves, up to a certain depth.
- Uses Alpha-Beta pruning to skip evaluating branches of the game tree that won't affect the result, optimizing performance.

### Winning Conditions

The game checks for winning conditions after every move:
- Horizontal: Four consecutive pieces in the same row.
- Vertical: Four consecutive pieces in the same column.
- Diagonal: Four consecutive pieces diagonally (both upward and downward).

### GUI

The game uses Pygame to display the following:
- A blue game board with empty circles.
- Red and Yellow circles representing the player's and AI's pieces.
- Messages indicating the winner once the game is over.

## Future Improvements

- Multiplayer Mode: Add an option for two players to play locally on the same computer.
- AI Difficulty Levels: Implement different difficulty levels for the AI (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
- Better AI Algorithms: Explore other AI algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for better performance and decision-making.
